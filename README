I was curious about this disassembler so I decided to import the known sources
for it and play around a bit. This is the result so far, and it's probably not
useful for anyone out there. Oh well.

See README.Smith, README.Finkelstein, and README.Bond for a history lesson. My
changes are all under GPL v2 as well of course, not that they amount to much:

  - lots of cleanup work regarding whitespace, warnings, casts, includes,
    opcodes, etc.
  - made the old c64.predefs file work again, added atari8bit.predefs
    courtesy of Brian Watson
  - cleaned-up error messages, some with more information than before
