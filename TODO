TODO
====

- figure out why my disassembly of the Apple 1 Basic ROM is different
  from Eric Smith's disassembly

- produce a decent disassembly of *something*, probably the C64 Basic
  ROM

- get the memory allocation stuff under control, it's a tad bit weird
  to have all that static allocation stuff but then malloc()s for six
  bytes at a time?

- maybe correct the length of "illegal" opcodes? the question is whether
  that'll actually improve the disassembly of anything; need a test case
  that actually has/uses those opcodes for sure

- get the file handling stuff under control, it's also a bit messy

- that queue is not a queue, it's a stack; figure out what it really
  should be

- it would be nice to use my own .equ defines in the .def file; for example
  to define the label of a function and to .trace it in the next line without
  having to repeat the address itself
